# Complete Issue Implementation

Complete end-to-end feature development workflow for issue #$ARGUMENTS

## Phase 1: Deep Analysis & Planning

### 1.1 Fetch and Analyze Issue

```bash
# Ensure project configuration is available
if [[ ! -f ".claude/project-config.json" ]]; then
    echo "üîÑ Discovering project configuration..."
    .claude/utils/get-project-config.sh
fi

# Get issue details and move to "In Progress" in GitHub Projects
gh issue view $ARGUMENTS
.claude/utils/move-item-status.sh "$ARGUMENTS" "in_progress"
gh issue edit $ARGUMENTS --add-label "in-progress"
```

### 1.2 Requirements Analysis

Perform deep thinking analysis:

- **User Story**: Extract who, what, why from issue description
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Identify all must-have requirements
- **Technical Scope**: Determine affected components/areas
- **Dependencies**: Check for blocking issues or prerequisite work
- **Edge Cases**: Consider error states, boundary conditions
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, accessibility

### 1.3 Human Validation Required

‚ö†Ô∏è **STOP FOR HUMAN REVIEW** when any of these apply:

- **Architectural Changes**: New patterns, frameworks, or system design
- **Database Schema Changes**: New tables, columns, or relationships
- **API Breaking Changes**: Changes that affect existing integrations
- **Security Implications**: Authentication, authorization, or data handling
- **Performance Critical**: Changes affecting system performance
- **External Dependencies**: New third-party services or libraries
- **Infrastructure Changes**: Deployment, configuration, or environment changes

**Extended Thinking for Critical Decisions:**
For complex architectural or security-related changes:
> "Think deeply about implementing this issue: $ARGUMENTS. Consider the architectural implications, security considerations, performance impact, and integration challenges. Think harder about potential edge cases, failure modes, and long-term maintainability."

**Present Analysis to Human**:
- Summary of technical approach
- Extended thinking analysis results
- Architectural decisions and alternatives considered
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Implementation timeline and complexity estimate
- Wait for explicit approval before proceeding

### 1.4 Break Down Into Tasks

If complex feature, create implementation plan:

- Research tasks for unknowns
- Design tasks for UI/UX work
- Implementation tasks by area (UI, Core, CLI, etc.)
- Testing tasks for each component
- Documentation tasks

## Phase 2: Environment Setup

### 2.1 Create Feature Branch

```bash
# Create branch following project naming convention
# Adapt prefix based on issue type: feature/, fix/, hotfix/, etc.
git checkout -b feature/issue-$ARGUMENTS
git push -u origin feature/issue-$ARGUMENTS
```

### 2.2 Optional: Create Worktree for Isolation

For complex features requiring parallel work, see @create-worktrees.md:

```bash
# Example using worktree for isolation
git worktree add ../$(basename $(pwd))-issue-$ARGUMENTS feature/issue-$ARGUMENTS
cd ../$(basename $(pwd))-issue-$ARGUMENTS
```

## Phase 3: Test-First Development Workflow

### 3.1 Reference Code Guidelines

Ensure implementation follows project standards:

- **Python**: Use `.claude/code-guidelines/python.md` (uv, FastAPI, 300-line limit)
- **TypeScript**: Use `.claude/code-guidelines/typescript.md` (bun, TanStack Router, shadcn/ui)
- **React**: Use `.claude/code-guidelines/react.md` (React 19, Server Components, modern patterns)
- **General**: Maintain file size limits, modular design, proper error handling

### 3.2 TDD Workflow: Write Test ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Iterate

#### Step 1: Write Tests First (RED)

**A. Unit Tests**
```bash
# Create test files for core functionality
# Focus on business logic and API contracts

# Example for backend (Python/FastAPI)
touch tests/test_user_service.py
touch tests/test_auth_endpoints.py

# Example for frontend (React/TypeScript)  
touch src/components/__tests__/LoginForm.test.tsx
touch src/hooks/__tests__/useAuth.test.tsx
```

**B. Integration Tests**
```bash
# API integration tests
touch tests/integration/test_auth_flow.py

# Frontend integration tests
touch src/__tests__/auth-flow.integration.test.tsx
```

**C. UI Tests with Playwright MCP**
```bash
# Create Playwright test files
mkdir -p tests/e2e
touch tests/e2e/auth-flow.spec.ts

# Use Playwright MCP for UI validation
# Tests will be created using natural language with MCP
```

#### Step 2: Commit Tests (Initial Commit)

```bash
# Commit failing tests first
git add tests/ src/**/*.test.*
git commit -m "test: Add comprehensive test suite for issue #$ARGUMENTS

- Unit tests for core business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints  
- E2E tests for user workflows
- Tests currently failing (RED phase)

Related to #$ARGUMENTS"
```

#### Step 3: Implement Code (GREEN)

**A. Backend Implementation**
```bash
# Implement minimal code to pass tests
# Follow test requirements exactly
# Use TDD red-green-refactor cycle
```

**B. Frontend Implementation**  
```bash
# Implement UI components
# Follow React 2025 best practices
# Use Server Components where appropriate
```

**C. Validate with Playwright MCP**
```bash
# Use Playwright MCP to validate UI behavior
# Natural language commands like:
# "Test the login form with valid credentials"
# "Verify error messages display correctly"
# "Check responsive design on mobile viewport"
```

#### Step 4: Iterate and Refactor (GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)

**A. Code Quality Pass**
```bash
# Refactor while keeping tests green
# Extract reusable components
# Optimize performance
# Improve readability
```

**B. Additional Test Coverage**
```bash
# Add edge case tests
# Test error conditions
# Add accessibility tests with Playwright
```

#### Step 5: Final Commit

```bash
# Commit working implementation
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Implement [feature] for issue #$ARGUMENTS

- ‚úÖ All tests passing (GREEN phase)
- ‚úÖ Code refactored for quality
- ‚úÖ UI validated with Playwright
- ‚úÖ Accessibility requirements met
- ‚úÖ Performance optimized

Closes #$ARGUMENTS"
```

### 3.3 Playwright MCP Integration for UI Validation

#### Automated UI Testing
Use Playwright MCP for comprehensive UI validation:

**A. Functional Testing**
- Form submissions and validations
- User interaction flows
- State management verification
- API integration testing

**B. Visual Testing**
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Responsive design validation
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.2)
- Performance metrics collection

**C. User Journey Testing**
- Complete user workflows
- Error state handling
- Loading state validation
- Multi-step form processes

#### MCP Commands for UI Testing
```javascript
// Use natural language with Playwright MCP:
// "Create a test that validates the login form"
// "Test the user registration flow end-to-end"
// "Verify mobile responsiveness of the dashboard"
// "Check accessibility compliance for the form"
```
